# Remote Bioelectronics for ES 53 - Fall 2020

Code for EMG / ECG labs in remote offering of ES 53, for use with Arduino UNO and Olimex shields

There are two separate but related elements in this repo:

1. The Arduino sketch (.ino / .cpp) necessary to digitize the incoming signal, and
2. The Processing code students will use to connect to the device, visualize, and save data from the device. 

Development of (1) has taken place in Visual Studio Code within the PlatformIO extension.
